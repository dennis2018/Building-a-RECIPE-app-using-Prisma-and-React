# Building-a-RECIPE-app-using-Prisma-and-React

Building a recipe app using prisma and react(In the last couple of years, GraphQL has taken on the scene in terms of frontend development due to the various advatanges it offers over REST.)

However, setting up your own GraphQL server is challenging, it's both error-prone and complicated. This has been made easier due to managed services such as Prisma which does the heavy lifting in your GraphQL server making it easier for you to instead focus on the development of you app.

In this tutorial, we will be building a fully functional Recipe app using Prisma and React.
